Parity
======

Shell commands for development, staging, and production parity for Heroku apps.

Prerequisites
-------------

Your development machine will need these command-line programs:

    curl
    heroku
    pg_restore

On a Mac,
`curl` is installed by default
and the other programs can be installed with Homebrew:

    brew install heroku-toolbelt
    brew install postgres

Install
-------

OSX:

    brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
    brew install parity

On other systems you can:

1. Download the package for your system from the [releases
page][releases]
2. Extract the tarball and place it so that `/bin` is in your `PATH`

Alternatively, you can do the following on all systems (requires a ruby
installation):

    gem install parity

All these methods install the following three shell commands:

    development
    staging
    production


[releases]: https://github.com/croaky/parity/releases

Usage
-----

Backup a database:

    production backup
    staging backup

Restore a production or staging database backup into development:

    development restore production
    development restore staging

Restore a production database backup into staging:

    staging restore production

Open a console:

    production console
    staging console

Open [log2viz][1]:

    production log2viz
    staging log2viz

Migrate a database and restart the dynos:

    production migrate
    staging migrate

Tail a log:

    production tail
    staging tail

Use [redis-cli][2] with your `REDIS_URL` add-on:

    production redis-cli
    staging redis-cli

The scripts also pass through, so you can do anything with them that you can do
with `heroku ______ --remote staging` or `heroku ______ --remote production`:

    watch production ps
    staging open

Convention
----------

Parity expects:

* A `staging` remote pointing to the staging Heroku app.
* A `production` remote pointing to the production Heroku app.
* There is a `config/database.yml` file that can be parsed as Yaml for
  `['development']['database']`.
* The Heroku apps are named like `app-staging` and `app-production`
  where `app` is equal to `basename $PWD`.

Customization
-------------

Override some of the conventions:

```ruby
Parity.configure do |config|
  config.database_config_path = "different/path.yml"
  config.heroku_app_basename = "different-base-name"
  config.redis_url_env_variable = "DIFFERENT_REDIS_URL"
end
```

If you have Heroku environments beyond staging and production (such as a feature
environment for each developer), you can add a [binstub] to the `bin` folder of
your application. Custom environments share behavior with staging: they can be
backed up and can restore from production.

Here's an example binstub for a 'feature-geoff' environment, hosted at
myapp-feature-geoff.herokuapp.com.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'parity'

if ARGV.empty?
  puts Parity::Usage.new
else
  Parity::Environment.new('feature-geoff', ARGV).run
end
```
